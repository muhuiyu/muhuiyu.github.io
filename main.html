      <p class="small">* SLRNCL is just my last and first name without vowels &mdash; it looks cool and honestly I don't like the idea of having a personal brand. It also happens to be hard to spell and remember, which is great when I'm not looking for a job (most of the time).

      <p>
        I'm currently doing some web design stuff at <a class="link" href="https://github.com/" title="Github">Github</a>. I'm used to working in fast-paced environments and collaborating with interdisciplinary teams. I'm a generalist focused on craft and driven by quality.
        My design approach is realistic and creative, supported by skills in frontend development &mdash; all that to say that I know how to translate my ideas into <span class="tag">HTML</span> and <span class="tag">CSS</span> (sometimes even a bit of <span class="tag">Javascript</span> if you let me use jQuery). My specialty is <span class="tag">web design</span> but have been enjoying creating all sorts of visuals like <span class="tag">icons</span> and <span class="tag">prototypes</span>. I also occasionnally dabble with <span class="tag">illustrations</span>. You can see my most recent stuff on <a class="link" href="https://dribbble.com/SLRNCL" title="SLRNCL on Dribbble">Dribbble</a> or the few case studies I have up on <a class="link" href="https://www.behance.net/SLRNCL" title="SLRNCL on Behance">Behance</a>.

      <h2>The rest</h2>

      <p>
        I was born and raised in France, then in late 2016, this <a class="link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kojessica/" title="Jessica Ko">lovely lady</a> found me on dribbble and flew me to the Bay Area to join Opendoor's design team where I spent 5 years. I do a bunch of other things on the side like writing low-quality <a class="link" href="https://medium.com/@SLRNCL" title="SLRNCL on Medium">posts</a>, collecting <a class="link" href="https://slrncl.com/notetoself/"  title="Nicolas Quote Collection">quotes</a> and sharing pretentious <a class="link" href="https://unsplash.com/@slrncl" title="SLRNCL on Unsplash">photos</a>. I even got married and developed and deep appreciation for eggs, cycling and stretching. Aside of that I sometimes add to my old <a class="link" href="https://slrncl.tumblr.com/" title="SLRNCL on Tumblr">moodboard</a> and have been <a class="link" href="https://folio.procreate.art/slrncl" title="SLRNCL on procreate folio">drawing</a> a bit too.

        I'm trying to slow down and be more present. Plan for the next step. Still riding in the east bay.

        &copy;SLRNCL &mdash; There is not much to steal here... Also I don't track anything here, no cookies for you bud'. Just in case you wonder, this very unimpressive page has been coded by myself. I have been flirting with burnout for a while and am still figuring a bunch of things such as how to never have to update my portfolio, ever. So I made this page, to feed the soul, starve the ego (and use as many em dash as possible).</p>
