    <h2>Residence of the Police Officers: Locals vs. Non-Locals</h2>
    <p class="text-block">
        In about two-thirds of the U.S. cities with the largest police forces, the majority of police officers commute to work from another town. On average, among the 75 U.S. cities with the largest police forces, 60 percent of police officers reside outside the city limits. (These figures exclude Honolulu, for which detailed data on residency was not available.) But the share varies radically from city to city. In Chicago, 88 percent of police officers live within the city boundaries — and in Philadelphia, 84% do. But only 23% do so in Los Angeles. Just 12% of Washington police live in the District — and only 7% of officers in Miami live within city limits.
        <br><br>
        According to the research statistic, cities may also vary in their residency requirements — for example, Los Angeles doesn’t require police to live in the city; Philadelphia used to require that its officers live within the city boundaries. Furthermore, such regulations are enforced to varying degrees. Whereas Boston ostensibly has a residency requirement for police, for example, it’s routinely flouted — and the Census Bureau data suggests that about half of Boston’s police officers live outside the city. Geography also plays some role. Jacksonville, Florida, has more than 80% of its police officers living within the city limits. That may reflect its sprawling boundaries; the city proper has an unusually high share of the metro area’s population. By contrast, the city of Atlanta, which is small compared with metro Atlanta’s population, has just 14% of its police force living in town.
