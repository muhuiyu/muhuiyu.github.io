    <h2>Percentage Of Local Police Officers In Each Race In A City</h2>
    <p class="text-block">
        In the second chart, we see the difference of residence in different cities. These differences reflect a combination of three major factors: a city’s racial composition, whether it has a residency requirement for police and its geography.
        On average among the 75 cities, 49% of black police officers and 47% of Hispanic officers live within the city limits. But just 35% of white police officers do. The disparity is starkest in cities with largely black populations. In Detroit, for example, 57% of black police officers live in the city but just 8% of white ones do. Memphis, Tennessee; Baltimore; Birmingham, Alabama; and Jackson, Mississippi — also majority black — likewise have large racial gaps in where their police officers live.<br><br>
        Black and Hispanic officers are considerably more likely to reside in the cities they police than white ones. In New York, for example, 62% of the police force resides within the five boroughs — a comparatively high figure. But there’s a stark racial divide. Seventy-seven% of black New York police officers live in the city, and 76% of Hispanic ones do, but the same is true for only 45% of white officers.
