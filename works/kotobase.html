          <h2>Why did I start this project?</h2>
          <h3>My Personal Experience</h3>
          <p>For me, Tranditional Chinese is my mother tougue, and English will be my secondary language. My Japanese is upper-intermediate levels, and I know basic conversational Vietnamese. Besides, I just started learning Korean and French this year as well.</p>

          <h3>Hanzi System and Loanwords</h3>
          <p>One of the interesting things is that, Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese, it refers to the Chinese characters that those four languages all make use of in their writing systems, called Hanzi (Chinese), Kanji (Japanese), Hanja (Korean), and Hán Tự (Vietnamese), respectively. Chinese is written entirely in Hanzi, and the rest of three make heavy use of Chinese characters.</p>

          <p>However, Hanzi, Kanji, Hanja, and Hán Tự are not the same thing. Even they're all using "Chinese characters", the sets are slightly (or you can say considerably) different from the others. I still stand by the statement that all character sets are the same most of the time, but I’m getting more interested in specifically those character sets, how much they overlap and where they vary.</p>

          <p>Another fun fact is that, you can easily find tons of loanwords in Japanese and Korean, same as Vietanmese and French, and English and French. Finding loanwords in my target language actually helps me discover that I already know some vocabulary, which does help me a lot to approach a new language in the long term. However, some aspects need to be considered: not all the words that look similar are loanwords. Instead, they can be false friends. To make matter even more difficult, not all loanwords are pronounced or spelled exactly in the same way, which makes it harder to be recognized right away.</p>


          <h3>Let's Make the App!</h3>
          <p>With those concerns and a personal need of mine, I and my friend, who's also a multiple-language learner, started this project called "Kotobase" (we're making a pun of "database" and "kotoba", which means "vocabulary" in Japanese). With kotobase, which provides vocabularies (mini-dictionaries of about 1000-2000 entries) of 10 languages from around the world, multiple-language learners can easily find and compare characters, loanwords, source words across languages.

          <h2>Research</h2>
          <h3>Supporting theories</h3>
          <p>To design a tool that could help ployglosts learn a language in a more practical and contextual way, I have to understand what it takes for multiple-language learners to approach a new language from a scientific perspective first. The following Articles helped me lean the stages of multiple-language acquisition and the motivational factor and different approaches for learning a language:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="http://vli-journal.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/vli.v05.1.nakao-onlinefirst.pdf" target="_blank">Loanwords for Language Learners: Help or Hindrance?</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://www.sdkrashen.com/content/books/sl_acquisition_and_learning.pdf" target="_blank">Second Language Acquisition and Second Language Learning</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1418315?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents" target="_blank">An Experimental Comparison of Active Recall and Recognition</a></li>
          </ul>
          <h4>a. Loanwords learning</h4>
          <p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loanword" target="_blank"><b>loanword</b></a> is a word adopted from one language (the donor language) and incorporated into another language without translation. However, in some cases, the original meaning shifts considerably through unexpected logical leaps. Spending some time looking for familiar loanwords when starting learning a new language may also bring benefits since the learner might be surprised about how much of the target language he/she can understand thanks to shared vocabulary.
          </p>
          <h4>b. Spaced repetition System</h4>
          <p><b>Spaced repetition system</b> is an evidence-based learning technique where the subject is asked to remember a certain fact with the time intervals increasing each time the fact is presented or said, and that is usually performed with flashcards.</p>
          <p>This system, also known as the spacing effect, was first described by German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus back in 1885. You can find more information from the <a href="https://www.studentdoctor.net/2018/07/31/spaced-repetition/" target="_blank">Website</a> and the YouTube video down below.</p>

          </div>
          <br><br>
          <h4>c. Active Recall</h4>
          <p><b>Active recall</b> is a principle of efficient learning, which claims the need to actively stimulate memory during the learning process. It contrasts with passive review, in which the learning material is processed passively (e.g. by reading, watching, etc.). </p>
          <p>Compared with passive review, active recall works because it is based on the principle that in order to learn and remember your material, you need to stimulate your brain to recall something from your long-term memory. You can find more information from the Wikipedia Page: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_recall#:~:text=Active%20recall%20is%20a%20principle,%2C%20watching%2C%20etc.)." target="_blank">Active Recall</a>.</p>

          <h3>A bit of Background of myself</h3>
          <p>I used to work in <a target="_blank" href="https://ckip.iis.sinica.edu.tw/">CKIP lab (Chinese knowledge and information processing lab in Sinica, Taiwan)</a> as a research assistant. One of our jobs during the time is to re-build and update our dictionary database system called <a  target="_blank" href="https://ckip.iis.sinica.edu.tw/project/ehownet/">E-HowNet</a>, which is a ontological system for lexical knowledge and common sense knowledge representation and processing. </p>
          <p>Here is the <a target="_blank" href="http://ehownet.iis.sinica.edu.tw/">online demo of E-HowNet system</a>.</p>
          <img src="../assets/img/nlp-1.png">
          <p>With this structure and algorithm, I can easily find our the entity-relations between words and break it down into differnet lexical concepts. Based on the concepts, common sense knowledge is extracted and learned by automatic parsed texts, which can be linked to different languages with concept associations.</p>

          <h3>Qualitative Interviews</h3>
          <p>To understand more the needs of potential users the potential of the tool I'm about to design, I talked to 4 of my ployglost friends: French, Japanese, Korean, and Vietanmese native speakers, who are learning English & Chinese, Korean & Chinese, Chinese, and Chinese & Japanese, respectively. The questions were focused on finding out their study habits, tools & methods, the challenges they are confronted with, and how the similarity between languages helps them in the process, etc.</p>

              <p>“As a French native speaker, English is relatively easy to learn but it does take some time and effort. Having so much common vocabulary helps a lot! While for Chinese, it's quite hard to memorize those characters since I've never learned any languages with Chinese-writing system before. One of the biggest chanllenge for me is the strokes and writing. To remember the orders, I try to break the characters down into components, and visualize the characters in mind. I also watching Chinese series with Chinese subtitles, but sometimes the word comes too fast for me to capture the meaning.”<br><b>- Charlie, 32 y/o, French learning English and Chinese</b></p>

              <p>"When I'm learning Korean, to be honest, similarity of grammatical structure is a big advantage, which means I could "think in Korean" and translate it word for word, and still sounded ok half the time. While sometimes similarity could be another problem to me, especially when I learn Chinese. One of the issues is that Chinese hanzi and Japanese kanji are being pronounced differently, and the meanings often vary between hanzi and kanji as well.”<br><b>- Ryohei (遼平), 21 y/o, Japanese learning Korean and Chinese</b></p>

              <p>“I thought learning Chinese would be much easier for Korean since we have our hanja (chinese characters) system, and actually hanja did help me to pair the words and meanings. Being reasonably acquainted with hanja, sometimes I can make fairly good guesses as to know the Chinese equivalent may sound (after knowing the Chinese equivalent sound to the attached character). However, I still need to learn the characters, and that could be quite a challenge considering that Modern Korean script is phonetic.”<br><b>- Jaeung (재웅), 24 y/o, Korean learning Chinese</b></p>

              <p>“In Vietnamese, there are a lot of cognates or borrowed words from Chinese, both are tonal, both are SVO and Vietnamese is heavily Chinese influenced. However, although they may have lots of things in common, but they do not belong to the language family. A prominent feature of Vietnamese is modifiers follow the nouns, whereas in Chinese, the modifiers are often before the nouns. So one can notice that even with borrowed Chinese vocabulary, Vietnamese will sometimes look odd compared to other Chinese-influenced (same as Japanese) languages because of the reverse order.”<br><b>- Quốc Anh, 29 y/o, Vietnamese learning Chinese and Japanese</b></p>

          <h2>Findings and Insights</h2>
          <h3>Key Findings</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>The similarity between languages does help ployglots to link the meanings and pronunciations between different languages, and may give fairly good guesses when seeing a new word.</li>
            <li>With the similarity in grammar and words, learner can pick up a language much easier in the earliest hours by and have more fun along the way.</li>
            <li>Compared to beginners, advanced language learners are more likely to capture words through immersion (e.g. film, series, books).</li>
          </ul>
          <br>          
          <h3>Common pain points:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>For Westerners and other people whose native language script is based on phonetic, learning Chinese character system could be quite a challenge.</li>
            <li>Some loanwords have different meanings from original language.</li>
            <li>When similar grammar structure could be an advantage during most of the time, those slightly different parts may cause another nightmare to ployglots since those may not be noticeable sometimes.</li>
            <li>Finding a way to take notes through language immersion without feeling about being interrupted.</li>

          <h2>The Learning Process and Problem Diagnosis</h2>
          <h3>Defining the problem statement</h3>
          <p>After gathering the findings from the research, I worked with my teammate to define the problem statement.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Language learners tend to make connections between native and second (or more) language. While they are frustrated with finding a good resource to collect, compare, and <b>take advantage of the similarity in languages</b>, especially for multiple language learners.</li>
            <li>Learners need to find the motivation and learning tips when <b>starting a new language which barely has no similarity and connection</b> in any known languages from the learner.</li>
            <li>Learners may be getting ahead of their path because <b>they have little visibility over the skills that they lack, what they need to do to get there, and how well they are tracking towards their goal</b>, which is happening in both completely beginners and advanced learners.</li>
          </ul>
          <p> </p>

        </div>

        <div class="work-white" data-aos="fade-up">
          <h3>How might we?</h3>
          <p>Based on the insights I got from the interviews and the problem statement, we started formulating the "How Might We (HMW)" to get a clearer vision on what kind of tool should be designed that will fulfill the needs of the people. The questions that came out were:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>How might we help people improve their language skills?</li>
            <li>How might we help people learn lanugages by taking advangtage from another known language?</li>
            <li>How might we help people to change their approach to suit their strengths and weaknesses, and overcome the language-learning barriers?</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="work-white" data-aos="fade-up">
          <h3>Back to the theories</h3>
          <p>There are several supported theories can help us to build the learning process as I mentioned before:</p>
          <p>Once learners find a new word, the <mark><b>comparison and similarity</b></mark> from loanwords and origins between their known languages can help them to understand the word at the first glance. After a few days, the technique to <mark><b>active recall information</b></mark>, which is retrieving it from learner's memory, is another active way of learning. The recall technique helps to test if learners have really learned the subject. It is also helpful to combine recall with <mark><b>spaced repetition</b></mark>, which can incorporate increasing intervals of time between subsequent reviews of previously learned material and foster the language learning process.</p>

            <li><b>Set a goal.</b> Users can define their langauge learning goals (e.g. 5 min learning, 100 new words).</li>

              <p>For polyglot learners, learning languages by comparison and similarity is the shortcut to multilingualism. Kotobase makes it easy to <b>connect words in different languages</b> with a simple-to-use dictionary interface. <b>Word definition and Kanji learning session</b> with short and accessible samples helps to know the new words, and correct spelling and pronunciation as well. <b>Word list and flashcards</b> help to reflesh and memorize new vocabulary faster and more efficiently.</p>

          <p><b>1. Web and tablet version</b><br>
            While we were prototyping ideas on the mobile, I also drew more "far out" explorations happened on different platforms and devices to show how the product could look if we expanded upon the idea even further. </p>

          <p><b>2. Validation</b><br>
          Although we received lots of user validation and compliments during the project (mostly from our interviewees), the trouble with most of us is that we would rather be ruined by praise than saved by criticism. So our next step will be to reach out more real users and promote the app/website on either ProductHunt or Behance to collect more feedback, and conduct more usability testing as well.</p>
