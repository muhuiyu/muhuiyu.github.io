          			<p>With "NTU & ME", students can find team members and study partners with an independent application. They will not have to search chatrooms in their original social media applications because "NTU & ME" can help them to manage all study groups. In the "NTU & ME", members can have discussion and take notes in the class. Also, the notification and schedule functions make students more efficient on studying. At the end, the study group will auto-dismiss without embarrassment. With "NTU & ME", students can have more delighting and efficient in-class experience.</p>

					<h2 style="">Abstract</h2>
			        <p>For many students in National Taiwan University(NTU), finding group members and studying with good partners are annoying daily problems when a new semester starts, especially in general education class where students have to listen to courses with more than one hundred unfamiliar classmates from all departments. Every new semester, students are perplexed at finding suitable partners for group assignments and collaborative writing. After a series of discussion, we set a goal of <b>improving students' social and studying experience when they must find a group to finish professors' assignments and to get grades in examinations</b>.</p>
        			<p>Accordingly, to achieve our goal and satisfy our schoolmates' need of grouping and collaborative writing, we design an application called "NTU&ME" which can help students find group members and study partners. "NTU&ME" will <b>automatically arrange group members or studying partners for users based on their preference and need</b> which will be keyed in when users register for a new account. Furthermore, "NTU&ME" has various functions such as <b>chatting, schedule, noting, notification, and auto-dismissing</b>. With "NTU&ME", our schoolmates can have an efficient and great studying experience during every semester. </p>

					<h2 style="">Introduction</h2>
			        <p>According to interviews with schoolmates and our own experiences, we noticed that many professors will require students to find a group with four to six members who will make presentations or other assignments together during this whole semester in the first class of new semesters. For many students, this requirement is quite disturbing and embarrassing because they do not have enough acquaintances in the same class and do not know how to find partners who match well with them.</p>

			        <p>In addition, we find in certain courses, students need to take much note for the difficult and complicated context. Therefore, doing collaborative writing with others will be a helpful and efficient way for them to organize what teachers teach and to get good-looking grades. However, there is a same problem: they do not know how to find partners to taking collaborative notes in an unfamiliar circumstance.</p>

			        <p>Although there are already a few applications for NTU students to manage their studying life or make friends with classmates, such as NTU ceiba, NTU cool, Zuvio, or Colorgy, all of these applications do not provide an efficient way to ‘find’ studying partners. For example, in NTU ceiba and NTU cool, users can only see their group members lists and e-mail of each member while in Zuvio and Colorgy users can only see who is your classmates in the same class. However, they still do not satisfy the need of ‘seeking’ suitable members’ and ‘setting’ a group. Therefore, we try to design a new application to improve students’ problem of forming a group directly. <br><br></p>

					<h2>Empathize</h2>
					<h4>User Study</h4>
			        <p>First, we interviewed eighteen students, asking them about their class experience. Most of the respondents suggested that they often bothered by the class grouping since they took this class without any familiar friends. Also, they sometimes miss important information if they took sick leave or they lost their concentration in class. We collected these respondents as our users, and use the KJ method, Inter-relationship diagraph and the analysis of behavior to find patterns between users by the KJ method, and constructed two personas, 張承佑(Chang) and 康桑妮(Kang). </p>
			        <h4 style="padding-bottom: 15px; padding-top: 40px;">Inter-relationship diagraph</h4>
			        <p>After our observation, we divided our resources into different dimensions: emotion, behavior, location and needs of the seat and then wrote the keywords on the post-it notes. We tried to rearrange these notes into new classification like "during the class” and “my belongings” in order to find out the similarity between different observative records.  </p>
			        <h4 style="padding-bottom: 15px; padding-top: 40px;">Analysis of behavior</h4>
			        <p>According to our Inter-relationship diagraph, we distinguish several significant variables such as needs of plugs, distance between seat and walkway, and the number of belongings. We put our observative objects into these variables on the basis of the degree in order to find out our primary and secondary persona.</p>
			        <h4 style="padding-bottom: 15px; padding-top: 40px;">Persona</h4>
			        <p>In the sheet of analysis of behavior, we find some objects of observation have similar degree of certain variables. Therefore, we put similar objects together, divide them into two groups, and make our persona list. </p>
			        <p>Our primary persona, Chang, is a fourth-year college student. He is impatience, usually late to class and sometimes does not focus on the teachers. Also, he does not like to interact with strangers, rarely leave his seat during the break time but leaves out of classrooms as soon as possible when the lectures end. Actually, he just wants to get the credits from the class, and he got a lot of works or personal things in his life. So he needs to solve his tasks during the class without disturbance.</p>
			        <p>However, the secondary persona, Kang, is a freshman girl in the college. She loves to explore this new environment and makes more friends. Moreover, she also sets her study goal and wants to be a straight-A student in her college life. </p><br><br>

			        <p>In this stage, we concluded user behavior, found stakeholders, and defined the customer perspective map to make this problem more precise. We summed up the common pain points on the basis of our user research, and finally constructed the user journey map.</p>

					<h4>Value</h4>
			        <p>We want to make the in-class experience better by improving the relationship between students, especially on helping the student who is afraid of making friends or feels lonely. The product we designed will make students easier to find their team members and finish their team project, group report and so on. They can also take notes together conveniently by using our product.</p>
			        <h4>Service Blueprint</h4>
			        <p>To figure out how we can make the in-class experience better, we drew a Service Blueprint. First, we listed several scenarios like “In class”, “After class” and so on. Second, we found out all of the touch-points in these scenarios and decided which could be changed. Then we came up with some functions should have in our product. The two main functions are “Find teammates” and “Take notes together”. These functions should make users feel better in these scenarios. We also list what would be related to the touch-points and took them into consideration. Finally, we thought out of some ways that how we could make these functions be realized.</p>

					<h2>Conclusion</h2>
        			<p>NTU & ME is a friendly course assistant system with two main functions: grouping and collaborative writing. It also has functions such as reminder, calendar, class table importing, and class PPT importing. With NTU&ME, when professors require students to do a group assignment, students will no longer feel disturbed and embarrassed by finding group members. Besides, NTU&ME helps students seek like-minded classmates to learn together.  Every student will meet more new friends, and have a better learning experience. </p><br><br>
