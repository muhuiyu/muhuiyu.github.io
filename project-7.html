          <p>This hackathon is called “Startup Weekend Education Taipei”. <a href="http://communities.techstars.com/taiwan/taipei/startup-weekend/13029" target="_blank">Startup Weekend Education Taipei</a> is a 54-hour event designed to provide superior experiential education for technical and non-technical entrepreneurs. </p>
          <p>Beginning with open mic pitches on Friday, attendees bring their best ideas and inspire others to join their team. Over Saturday and Sunday teams focus on customer development, validating their ideas, practicing LEAN Startup Methodologies and building a minimal viable product. The whole design process should be done in 45 hours. Finally, on Sunday evening teams demo their prototypes and receive valuable feedback from a panel of experts. </p>
          <p>Our team, “Little House” (小屋子), wants to make an offline course platform to match educational resources, and we got the “Best in Design“ Prize in this hackathon. Here comes our design thinking, prototyping, and business model. </p>

        <h2 style="font-weight: 600; padding-bottom: 30px;">Problem Definition</h2>
        <p>First, we observed that most of teachers and students cannot find appropriate spaces to teach/learn. As a result, we spend much time on interviewing with 12 people (including teachers and students), making questionnaires Link], and analyzing results. The follows are my interviewees.</p>

      <h4 style="padding-top: 50px; padding-bottom: 10px;">Performing Art Teacher - Hans</h4>

      <p>Hans is a performing artist. He used to be actors, and now he teach performing art in Taiwan. Currently, he is not hired by schools but works in his own personal studio.</p>


      <p style="padding-left: 10px; border-left: 1px gray solid;"> When I want to start a new course, it's so hard and inconvenient to find an appropriate space with reasonable price for teaching. Sometimes I need a bigger space with mirrors or other equipments, so I spend much time on Google or asking friends.
      <br><br>
      Also, I want to promote my courses since most students in Taiwan only focus on those general subjects (e.g. Chinese, English, Mathematic, etc.). I want to let more people understand “performing art” and be touched by the great charm of performing art. However, I can only use Facebook or Line to share my new courses. It is time-consuming and inefficient since I need to build my connection network first, and copy & paste to each social media platform.

        <h4 style="padding-bottom: 15px;">Our Users & Their Needs/Pain Points</h4>
        <p><b>Teacher</b><br>- alternative teachers (teaching music, dancing, programming, or anything else)<br>- who does not teach in school, and they need spaces with specific needs</p>
        <p><b>Venue provider</b><br>- who has idle spaces and want to share/rent/make more value</p>
        <p><b>Student</b><br>- who want to learn some special courses which are not taught in general school</p>
        <h4 style="padding-top: 20px; padding-bottom: 15px;">Pain Points</h4>
        <p>
          1. Teachers cannot find an appropriate space/classroom<br>
          2. Teachers don’t have enough resources to promote their courses.<br>
          3. Students don't know where to find great extracurricular courses, and teachers need to be rated
        </p>
        <h4 style="padding-top: 20px; padding-bottom: 15px;">What is our unique value if we solved those problems?</h4>
        <p>
          1. Teachers can promote theirselves<br>
          2. More resources can be used

        <p>A offline course learning platform that matches resources between teachers and venue/resources providers. We used “crazy 8” and “brain storming” methods to collect great ideas. After that, our designer (me) integrated those ideas, made prototypes, and tested by users. We made 3 prototypes. First of two are papered-prototypes, and the last is a sketch-mockup. We tested our prototypes with 5 persons and got different feedbacks.<br><br></p>
